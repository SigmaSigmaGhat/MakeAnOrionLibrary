# How to use Orion.
Orion UI Library, is for Roblox, obviously, but how can you use it? Well Orion is for people who wants to make hubs, script hubs, but may not have an computer to make one in Roblox studio, or lazy people who don’t feel like making their own UI, in which why a lot of people tend to only use Library’s, now, how can you use this? By having an Roblox executor you can simply run scripts, any scripts, starting from GUIS to anything really.
# How to boot the library
Booting the library is one of the most easiest things to do, firstly, go to Orion, use an program that lets you type and add lines of text, and simply put
